		READ DESCRIPTION CAREFULLY
		
		Since the patch, myself and many others have experienced an issue preventing the saving of the game. 

		Specifically, this error "XXX.SaveGameData: The process cannot access the file because it is being used by another process."

		This temporary mod will disable the screenshot feature used to display a screenshot of your city in the load game menu and since the update, on the loading screen.

		So far, this mod does fix the issue but its not a guarentee.

		If you are experiencing this issue, and this mod does not fix it, please post your logs here https://discord.com/channels/1024242828114673724/1383198165012058133 (Cities: Skylines Modding discord)
		If this does fix it for you, please leave a comment below to let me know
